    <p><b>If you've never touched a Rubik's cube before, don't worry — this article will guide you from a curious beginner, to a confident cuber</b>. Cubing is not hyst about solving a puzzle; it's about unlocking a new hobby that blends logic, patience, and creativity.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is Cubing?</h3>
    <p>Cubing refers to solving twisty puzzles, most famously the <b>Rubik’s Cube.</b> Invented in 1974, it’s a 3×3 cube with six colored faces that can be scrambled into billions of combinations. The goal is simple: restore each face to a single color. But the journey is where the fun lies.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why Start Cubing?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mental workout</b>: Improves memory, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving.</li>
        <li><b>Stress relief</b>: The repititive turnnig can be suprisingly calming.</li>
        <li><b>Community</b>: Cubers worldwide share tips, compete, and celebrate progress.</li>
        <li><b>Accessibility</b>: You only need one cube to begin, and tutorials are everywhere online.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>First Steps for Beginners</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Get a cube</b>: Start with a standard 3x3. Modern cubes are smoother and easier to turn than the original.</li>
        <li><b>Learn notation</b>: Moves are written as letters (U = Up, R = Right, etc.). This helps you follow guides.</li>
        <li><b>Use the Layer-by-Layer (LBL) nethod</b>: The most common beginner approach. You solve the cube one layer at a time: <ul>
            <li>Make a cross on the first layer</li>
            <li>Solve the corners of that layer</li>
            <li>Complete the second layer</li>
            <li>Build the cross on the final layer.</li>
            <li>Finish the last corners to solve the cube.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Practice slowly</b>: Don't rush. Accuracy matters more than speed at first.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Tips to Stay Motivated</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Set small goals</b>: First solve, then under 5 minutes, under 3 minutes, under 2 minutes, and finally, under 1 minute.</li>
        <li><b>Watch tutorials</b>: Video guides make algorithms easier to understand.</li>
        <li><b>Join Communities</b>: Online forums and local cubs can help you learn faster</li>
        <li><b>Experiment</b>: Try different methods once you're comfortable - like CFOP or Roux - to expand your skills. Then practice the method that you like the most!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Beyond the 3x3</h3>
    <p>Once you've mastered the classic cube, explore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Other twisty NxN puzzles</b>: Try 2x2, 4x4, or even 5x5 cubes for a challenge.</li>
        <li><b>Shape mods, and other twisty puzzles</b>: Try Pyraminx, Skewb, Gear, Mirror, Clock, Domino, Tower and more!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Challenges to Expect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Frustration</b>: Early attempts may feel impossible. Stick with it - the cube is designed to be solvable.</li>
        <li><b>Algorithm overload</b>: Don't try to memorize everything at once learn step by step.</li>
        <li><b>Cheap cubes</b>: Avoid stiff, low-quality cubes; they make learning harder.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Cubing is for everyone - kids, adults, gamers, engineers, or anyone curios. <b>Your first solve will feel like magic</b>, and from there, every scramble becomes a new adventure. Start with patience, practice regularly, and soon you'l be part of a global community that celebrateds creativity through puzzles.</p>
